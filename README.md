# [RoboFriends](https://shehroze-1122.github.io/RoboFriends-usingHooks/)

A simple and fully optimal app build with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses the new React hooks and it is a function version of previous version which used class and redux for the smart component and can be seen [here](https://github.com/shehroze-1122/Robofriends-usingHooks)

It has a cool UI consisting of robots fetched using [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/) API and dummy users and emails fetched from [JSON placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) Fake Free API.

### Making it your own
